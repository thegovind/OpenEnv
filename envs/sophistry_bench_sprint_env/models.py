    On reset: ``prompt`` holds the full system prompt (passage + question +
    answer-to-defend), ``done`` is False.
    On step: ``prompt`` is empty, ``done`` is True, and ``metadata`` carries all
    eight reward components.

    ``reward``/``done`` are inherited from the base ``Observation`` (reward
    defaults to ``None``). Read the post-step reward from ``StepResult.reward``,
    not ``observation.reward``: the framework's serializer strips ``reward`` from
    the observation payload, so only ``StepResult.reward`` carries the weighted
    aggregate. ``reset()`` leaves ``reward`` as ``None`` (no action scored yet),
    matching the framework convention.

    The eight reward components are also mirrored in the declared ``components``
    field. The base ``metadata`` dict is stripped by the framework's HTTP
    serialization layer, so ``components`` is what survives the wire; the typed
    client re-populates ``metadata`` from it on the way back.
